    Welcome to Electronics Workbench Professional Edition
    =====================================================

    The Release Notes contain important information that was
    received too late to be included in the written documentation.

    They can be found in the online help. To view the release
    notes, start Electronics Workbench Professional Edition and
    choose Release Notes from the Help menu.

    Below is further information which was too late to be included
    in the online Help.

    Parser Errors Tab

    A new tab has been added to the Analysis Graphs Window, called
    "Parser Errors". The tab appears only if errors occur during
    the parsing of a subcircuit netlist model. (Note: Parsing
    occurs after you start a simulation or analysis.)

    Most of the errors appearing in this list are only warnings.
    They simply notify the user of syntax in a netlist which is
    unsupported by Electronics Workbench.

    Electronics Workbench User's Guide Corrections


    Page 5-5 - The circuit under Step 1 shows the first connection
    of the word generator connected to connector "S" and the second
    connection of the word generator connected to connector "R".
    This is reversed. The first connection of the word generator
    should be connected to connector "R" and the second to
    connector "S".

    The procedure for setting the logic analyzer under Step 1 is no
    longer correct as the logic analyzer was revised after the
    printing of the User's Guide and Technical Reference.

    The new procedure for setting the Logic Analyzer is as follows:

    1.  Set the frequency of the word generator to 1 MHz.
    2.  On the logic analyzer, set the clocks per division to 1.
    3.  Click on the set button in the clock box and ensure the
        following:
        -  Clock edge "negative"
        -  Clock mode "internal"
        -  Set internal clock rate to "1 MHz"
        -  Clock qualifier "x"
        -  Logic analyzer "Pre-trigger samples 100"
                          "Post-trigger samples 1000"
                          "Threshold voltage (V) 3.5"
    4.  Make sure the Current address on the word generator is 0000.
    5.  Click the Cycle button on the word generator.

    Technical Reference Corrections

    PAGE 14-22 - The picture of the opened logic analyzer is
    incorrect. Since the manual was printed, the Time Base feature
    has been removed and replaced with a Clocks per division
    feature.

    The "Time base" setting was used to set the logic analyzer's
    display in units of seconds/division. The "Clocks per division"
    setting is used to set the traces in units of clocks/division.
    The number of clocks refers to the number of samples of the
    data from the input terminals which have been taken.

    Page 14-23 - The third paragraph discusses how to specify the
    number of samples stored before and after triggering. The user
    can also specify the number of samples by selecting the set
    button in the clock box of the logic analyzer and making the
    appropriate changes.
